This Python code implements a simple arithmetic game where the player must solve mathematical problems within a chosen difficulty level. It begins by prompting the player to select a difficulty level between 1 and 2. Based on the selected difficulty, random numbers are generated for mathematical operations. The game loop continues until the player decides to exit by entering '-1'. During each iteration of the loop, the player is asked to solve arithmetic problems such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or a random operation. After each attempt, the player is provided with feedback indicating whether their answer is correct or wrong.
